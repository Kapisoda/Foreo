        <p>Foreo is a passionate, fun-loving team that lives to put an extra dash in your step as you walk out the door! When you feel good, you look good - and our mission is complete.</p>
        <p>To make this happen, we're bringing a new standard of high-end beauty and wellbeing solutions to a wider audience than ever before.</p>
        <p>Far too long, professional-level treatments have been the privilege of the wealthy few. That's not right, and it's a situation that's changing as fast as our team tears down old-fashioned designs and creates new technologies at sensible prices for all.</p>
        <p>That's also why we're called FOREO, short for "For Every One." It's because we strive to create groundbreaking, accessible solutions that bring happiness and benefit to everyday lives.</p>
